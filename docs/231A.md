## Description

This problem involves implementing a solution to determine whether a team of three people can solve a programming problem based on their knowledge. The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing three integers representing the knowledge level of each team member. The output should indicate the number of test cases where the team can solve the problem.

## Solution

"Here's how I solved it: The program starts by reading an integer n from the input, which represents the number of problems. For each problem, it initializes a counter to 0 and then reads the opinions of three team members. Each opinion is an integer that gets added to the counter. If the sum of the opinions is 2 or more, it means at least two team members agree on a solution, so the program increments an output counter. This process repeats for all n problems. Finally, the program prints the output counter, which represents the number of problems the team will implement."
